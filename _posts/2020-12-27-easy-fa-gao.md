[Fa Gao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa_gao) is a traditional Chinese bread which requires steamer to cook. 
It tastes pretty neat in my opinion, but you can have your own judge after giving it a try.

This recipe is directly adapted from this video on YouTube: [Brown Sugar Fa Gao](https://youtu.be/_q3RqGv9Qvc). 
You can skip everything down below if you understand Chinese, since they are essentially the same. 
I made the Fa Gao with this recipe myself so that I can be certain that it is easy to manage.

Ingredients:
- 200 grams room-temperature water
- 100 grams brown sugar
- 400 grams whole purpose flour
- 2 large eggs (around 50~60 grams each)
- 4 grams yeast
- some extra room-temperature water

You may also need the following cookwares:
- a whisk or something similar for blending mixtures
- a relatively large steamer (it might be hard to find in regular grocery stores, try Asian grocery stores)
- parchment paper
- a small container to resolve sugar
- a medium container (baking pan can do the job) that can be placed in the steamer
- a large bowl for blending mixtures

Steps of cooking:
1. Put 100 grams brown sugar into the 200 grams water, blend it until the sugar resolves
2. Put 400 grams whole purpose flour, 2 eggs, and the sugar water prepared last step into the large bowl.
3. Blend them together, and add more water if needed. 
You should blend it and add water until the mixture can drip down from the whisk smoothly.
4. Cover the bowl with sealing wrap to let the yeast perform.
The goal is to double the volume, which would probably take 1 hour. 
You can always place the bowl into warm water to accelerate this process.
5. Blend it gently once the fermentation is done.
6. Place parchment paper in the medium container, and pour the mixture into it.
7. Place the container into the steamer with cold water and start cooking.
8. When the water in the steamer is boiled, set the timer to 30 mins.
9. Get the Fa Gao out, and enjoy!

If the word description is not good enough for you, you can always go to check out the YouTube video mentioned above.
Although it is in Chinese, you still can get a general idea of what is what.
Hopefully you can make it without too much trouble! Have fun cooking!
