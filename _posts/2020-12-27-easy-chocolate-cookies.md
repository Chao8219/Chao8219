When you are in the mood of baking some cookies, I guess you probably won't want to make it complicated. 
Here is a recipe adapted directly from 
[Laura in the kitchen Epi # 1045](https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/chocolate-chunk-cake-batter-cookies/). 

You can watch this video first to get the general idea, and then check out my modified version.
Or if you like, you can follow that video completely, which could give your quite similar results.

Ingredients:
- 1 cup of chocolate cake mix (you can go to grocery store to buy the mix directly)
- 1/4 cup of unsalted butter (the most convenient one is the butter sticks - one stick is 1/4 cup)
- 1 large egg (around 50~60 grams without shell)
- some sea salts if you want (they can enrich the flavor)

Some cookwares you may need:
- oven
- parchment paper
- a baking pan (try the large one for cakes)
- a large bowl to mix the ingredients
- a spatula or a similar blending tool
- a small scoop (the table spoon works well for me) to place the mixture onto the parchment paper

Steps:
1. Place the butter in the large bowl and soft it with either patience or some warm water underneath the bowl.
2. Throw the cake mix and the egg into the bowl, and blend it until you don't see any cake mix dry powder or butter left.
3. Place the parchment paper onto the baking pan, and use the small spoon to scoop the mixture on the parchment paper.
Remember to leave enough space between each scoop.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 &deg;F.
5. While you are waiting, you can put some sea salts on the top of the dough. 
If you don't do this step, everything should be fine.
6. Once the oven is ready, bake it for 9 minutes.
7. After taking the pan out, try to resist the temptation of tasting. 
Give it a minute to cool down, and it would give your a much more rigid body.


Some tips:
- You can always try to use other flavor cake mix to make the cookies. 
It should be really similar.
The only key component is the butter.
- You can also include other things like chocolate chunk as mentioned in the original recipe. 
Maybe including some peanut or red date can be surprisingly good.
But if you want to include some raw ingredients, please bake it with more time until everything is fully cooked.
- I also tried doubled everything and it worked as expected. 
It just took more rounds to bake.
- As mentioned above, you can alter ingredients as you like. 
Among all of those, the sea salt can be replaced with cinnamon powder, or even wilder with paprika.
Just don't go too wild - explore it at your own pace.
